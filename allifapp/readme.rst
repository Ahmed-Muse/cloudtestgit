Welcome to Allifmaal ERP read me file.
The development of this app started back in the year late 2020.

This app is for online subscriptions and are to be used by the owners of various businesses.
1. The owner of the business is given a user creation link page so that they can create their login credentials.
2. Then the owner is directed to a page where they can create their company.
3. Then they are directed to the home page where they can access all the functionalities of the app.
4. If the owner(s) of the business want their employees to also access the application/ERP, then they can create user credentials for all their staff and their staff can change their passwords once they login.
5. Then all the employees/staff can now access the system.

NB. Since this application is subscription based, every subscriber will only see their data.
NB. Also the Allifmaal admin can access the app and see who has subscribed.
